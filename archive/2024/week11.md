## Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- [**Security Through Transparency: Scaling Your Customer Trust Program**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKB60fBiEHg)    
`🏷️ transparency`  `🏷️ scaling`  `🏷️ trust`  
The talk discusses how scaling a Customer Trust Program with limited resources can be achieved through increased transparency. It suggests using a public-facing wiki, bundling security documents, and starting a security Q&A database to share security program highlights with stakeholders. This approach aims to replace the legacy method of answering security questionnaires and sending out SOC 2 reports, facilitating faster sales cycles and a stronger reputation.
