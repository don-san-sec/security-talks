    to be released and applied, the potential for patches to break applications or
    not fully fix security issues, and the complications introduced by Infrastructure
    as Code (IaC) and container orchestration. The talk proposes using sandboxing
    and isolation to reduce the urgency of patching by limiting the impact of exploits
    and examines three examples of how these strategies can be implemented.
